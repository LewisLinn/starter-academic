I am currently a final year undergraduate student of computer science at Simon Fraser University. I am also a research assistant in SFU [GrUVi](https://gruvi.cs.sfu.ca) Lab, advised by [Prof. Angel Xuan Chang](https://angelxuanchang.github.io) and co-advised by [Prof. Manolis Savva](https://msavva.github.io).

My interests lie in 3D vision and graphics.
